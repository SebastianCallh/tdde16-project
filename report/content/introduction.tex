\chapter{Introduction}
With so much discussions taking place online, on a forum with
seemingly no personal responsibilities, it is not uncommon to hear of
discussions that derail into profanities, personal insults and racial
slurs. To make online forums more appealing, companies employ people
to moderate this kind of behaviour and remove user generated content
that is deemed unfit for their platform. If the process of reading
this content and deciding whether it should be censured or not could
be automated, time and money would be saved.

This project aim to evaluate the performance of a machine learning
model called Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) for this task.
