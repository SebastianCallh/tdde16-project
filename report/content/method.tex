\chapter{Method}
This chapter describes the data pre-processing and the implementation
process. The implementation goal was to create functional
implementation of an LSTM network using pre-trained FastText embeddings and a
Naive Bayes classifier.

\section{Pre-processing}
The first step was to sanitise the comments using regex
substitution. The pre-trained embeddings

\section{LSTM Network with FastText Embeddings}
To improve the performance of he LSTM model, FastText word embeddings
were investigated. When people from many different countries
communicate online using English, spelling errors are unavoidable.
